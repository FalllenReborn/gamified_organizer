**GAMIFIED ORGANISER**



1. **Lists for tasks.**
    1. List with customisable name to store tasks, each task has a marker (or menu if needed) to switch task status for example “pending” -> “completed”.
    2. Types of Lists:
        1. Daily - tasks which would get renewed on chosen days or in set intervals (with ability to exclude certain days).
        2. Tied - tasks which contribute to certain bar progression with ability to add other rewards including xp for other bars.
        3. Normal - list without any properties.
        4. Event - list which is active only on event days and gives XP/rewards for things that normally don’t give anything or cost points (these are also for free while event lists contain them).
        5. Purchuched - list with tasks available after getting them from the shop or as a reward.
        6. Informational - list of things to note without checkboxes, menus, timers or rewards, just raw notes.
        7. Thematic (mixed) - list which can contain categories working as any other list type.
    3. Any list can contain categories which look like tasks with subtasks but are indefinite, thematic lists’ categories function as nested lists.
    4. Users will be able to drag tasks from 1 list to another and will get notified that if list type changes they will need to update some things while others might get removed.
2. **Tasks.**
    5. Tasks are quests that can be named, and customized with options that would change their behavior.
    6. Types of tasks:
        8. Normal - singular completion task.
        9. Completion - task with completion bar where 1 or certain amounts of points is equal to some XP or reward, when used in daily list users can set minimum number of completion points needed to complete that task for the day.
        10. Lingering - task with set timer which would start to count after the task has been set by the user as started and when the timer gets to the end automatically gets marked as completed and notifies the user that they have completed the task.
        11. Lingering with prolongation - works like normal lingering but after timer stops it asks user if it should start counting in the other way and only after user marks it as completed it stops counting, user can chose in what percentage will bonus rewards get counted based on time required to get normal rewards (for example 2h for 10 XP with percentage set to 50% will after another 2h give 5 XP) user can also chose wich rewards will get counted as bonus rewards as well as add new bonus rewards available only after prolongation after certain time passed.
        12. Expiring - tasks with decaying rewards, users would be able to choose how fast and to what point rewards will lose their value, XP points can be lost by a certain amount over some time, free purchase will become discounts and singular rewards will be available to gain for a limited time.
    7. Task options.
        13. Timer - set timer after which task will get marked as failed.
        14. XP - set amount of XP which will be given to certain bars or bars after completion.
        15. Reward - write what activity are you able to do after completion or tie to something in the shop that requires points and gain it for free.
        16. Points - gain a certain amount of chosen types of points after completion.
3. **XP bars.**
    8. XP bars will feature progress bars with goals and points needed set by the user.
    9. XP bar types:
        17. Single time - disappear after completion.
        18. Repeatable - starts again after completion.
        19. Event - appears only for certain events and can be either single time or repeatable and if single time is chosen user can make event end after bar is filled.
    10. XP bar options:
        20. Name - user can name his bar as well as rename experience with something else.
        21. End reward - reward at the end.
        22. Interval reward - rewards given at certain intervals set by the user, if set in repeatable bar spare points get transferred to new iteration.
        23. Custom reward - reward set by the user at any point on the bar which will repeat on the same point on the next iteration of the repeating bar.
        24. End event - can be added to a single time event bar and ends the event on completion of the whole bar.
4. **Descriptions.**
    11. Each type of list, task, option and so on should feature a description button which would display information on what it does.
5. **Graphical representation.**
    12. Lists are represented as classical lists of things to do and can be arranged in custom positions on a grid or chaotically.
    13. Tasks are just text with menu/ checkbox and optional properties displayed like timer, subtasks are always glued to the main task but can be collapsed at any point.
    14. XP bars will showcase how much of progress has been made as well as numerical and percentage description of progress with option to show/ hide numerical/ percentage description, bars can be depicted as classic bars, wheals or some custom shapes like zigzag, fish or something crazy like dragon or tangled serpent.
    15. Users can choose if a specific element or all elements will push away interrupting elements or if the last element would be at the top or choose in what order should elements appear on top of each other.
    16. Users will be able to choose if they want to sort everything in static or detached sections or if they want to have everything in 1 section, if there are multiple sections users would choose if a section can store all types of elements or specific elements and how many of each element can be stored in that section.
    17. Sections can be organized on classic squared grid where sections could be removed or elements could be resized to create bigger cells, user would also be able to create custom shaped grids so that they could create something crazy like a city or a board game or don't use grid at all and for example treat his organizer like a quest board.
6. **Language change.**
    18. Simple switch between English and Polish with easy option to add more.
7. **Themes/ skins.**
    19. Organizers will have a simple way to create and add new themes and skins for elements like texture packs in Minecraft.
    20. Packs of skins would be ready to use skins for multiple elements from which the user could choose which to use and when.
    21. Themes would be ready to use organizers with skins for everything, its own grid and already named or even filled elements so that the user would be able to share his adventure with others and other users with less time or motivation to start right away without the need to create their organizer from the beginning.
    22. Skins would change look and hitbox (hitboxes are for collisions with other elements so that they will be able to push each other away if needed) of every possible element.
        25. XP bars.
        26. Fonts.
        27. Checkboxes.
        28. Menus.
        29. Lists.
        30. Sections.
        31. Background (user would be able to place multiple pictures on background and set their visibility priority so that they can create whatever they want as a background like for example a village or a visual representation of their points of interest so that they could sort lists/ sections on those places visually).
        32. Timer.
        33. Depictions of rewards.
        34. Description.
        35.  Description button.
8. **Events.**
    23. Events can be created by the user and can manipulate other lists.
    24. Users can make other lists disabled during the event (all, specific or none).
    25. Events can add new things to the store.
    26. During the event normal tasks can give bonus rewards.
    27. During the event multiplayer can be set for all or specific rewards on all or specific tasks.
    28. Events can trigger the appearance of new lists or lists of things that normally are not rewarded or are themselves rewards and will give rewards during the event, event lists can have their own event bar.
    29. Event tasks can be tied to already existing tasks, for example completion lists with movies to watch with additional description “Movie day: watch as many movies as possible from 6:00 AM to 3:00 AM (next day)” , these tied tasks can be depicted in the event section but don't need to be.
    30. Events can be ended or paused by user or ended after completion of event XP bar
9. **Points and store.**
    31. Stores can be set by the user and use multiple currencies.
    32. In store the user can add special tasks, multipliers or other rewards.
    33. Items in store can have special properties:
        36. Limited time - you are able to buy only for a certain time set by the user.
        37. Currency changing in intervals - if a user sets interval for example to 1 day each day currency will switch to another (any other or from pool created by user) at random or in set order.
        38. Cost multiple types of currency - users can make something purchasable in any currency, in currency from the pool or make something cost multiple currencies, and each can have the property of being able to be bought with any currency.
        39. Limited - Users can limit some purchases to some amount per some amount of time.
10. **Time & Date. ***
    34. 
11. **Notifications. ***
    35. 
12. **Account. ***
    36. Account which would store users’ organizers to allow them to log in on different devices and/ or join other users in shared organizers.
13. **Coop/ rivalry. ***
    37. Users can join shared organizers and interact as:
        40. Viewers - capable of seeing each other progress but only with self created tasks on rules to which they both need to agree (rules can be same for both users or some rules can be more demanding/ forgiving for certain users). Users can share tasks meant for them by the rules but they both need to accept it unless they buy a pass in a shop which allows them to steal or force a task sharing.
        41. Coop - users create common rules, and share tasks even if some of them are only for certain user (can set to only completable by certain user but editable by all) and after completing task either all users get rewarded, team gets rewarded, certain users gets rewarded or only user which completed task gets rewarded.
        42. Rivalry - Users create common rules but some rules can be more demanding/ forgiving for certain users, they can create their own tasks as well as tasks for other users, each user contributes towards their own goals, but tasks given by other users count for better rewards than normal so that users giving away every task will not only not get any points for shop but also help other player, shop in rivalry can contain things to fight of lazy users by locking them with certain tasks, or giving them small penalties.
14. **Social page.**
    38. 
15. **Offline view of owned/downloaded projects.**
    39. If the server is down or a user don’t have internet connection they can still view some of data:
        43. locally stored projects and parts of projects.
        44. downloaded projects and parts of projects.
        45. projects and parts of projects synchronized through cloud
        46. downloaded/ locally stored themes and skins
16. **Anti data flooding.**
    40. Users have limited free space to save projects on the cloud.
        47. Users can mark projects as cloud sync. and have them available on all devices
        48. Users can save data on their current device by not enabling cloud sync. and these projects and/or parts of projects will be visually displayed as part of the local environment on device “name_of_device”.
        49. Users can send projects and/or parts of projects to other devices through the internet or some other type of connection.
    41. Users can develop big projects and save them on cloud but only through paid cloud space (subscription or permanently bought**).
    42. Users can send skins and themes to public view but only as part of separate cloud space (if user creation gets enough recognition they might get awarded with something like storing recognized creation with no effect on creation cloud space**). 
17. **Sending creations for public use. ****
    43. _Main challenge is copyright but it might not be a problem as this kind of use is not generating any profit to users though it might create a problem of giving recognition to a wrong person when creation is less recognized overall or gets copied all over the internet and the platform._
    44. 
18. **API.**
    45. Easy to read documentation
19. **Scrap friendly.**

**Core concepts**



* No negative points - since the organizer's role is to motivate to complete tasks, penalties are against the organizer's role.
* Full customizability - user is supposed to create his own adventure in life so customizability needs to be treated as one of main forces.

**Ideas for later** *



* Map integrity to create list of places to visit with option to choose shortest path (in plans adding more points than limit of google maps)
* “Maszyna losująca” - option to pick tasks which can get randomly chosen in lottery, lottery tickets might be bought in shop
* Tables - option to create excel like tables
* Statistics - some data on task progression, some easy to read graphs and stuff like that

**WORK PLAN**



1. **Backend**
    1. Python  →  Django
2. **Database**
    2. PostgreSQL
3. **Frontend**
    3. JavaScript  →  React.js

**~~PROTOTYPE PLAN~~ (scraped)**



1. **Manage lists.**
    1. Lists are just dictionaries of dictionaries.
    2. List types are described in single list from which proper method will pull 1 value which describes list functionality
        1. list_types = [‘normal’, ‘daily’, ‘tied’, ‘event’, ‘purchuched’, ‘informational’, ‘thematic’]
    3. List type gets described in template:
        2. list_name = {

            	list_type = list_type[1]


            }

2. **Manage tasks.**
    4. Status gets added to the dictionary of tasks to describe possible statuses. These are just depictions of statuses for certain properties added to task and they are combined in one list so that each status has its own order number:
        3. daily_status = [‘pending’, 0,  ‘done’]  →  number in the middle stands for number of days this task awaits
        4. lingering_status = [‘pending’, ‘started’,  ‘done’, ‘pause’]
        5. prolonged_status = [‘pending’, ‘started’, ‘prolonged’,  ‘done’, ‘pause’]
        6. timer_status = [‘pending’, ‘done’, ‘failed’]
        7. status_list = [‘pending’, 0,  ‘done’, ‘started’, ‘prolonged’, ‘failed’, ‘pause’]
    5. Tasks are described using template:
        8. {

            ‘task_name’ : ‘name’,  →  this gets describe as dict key


            ‘status’ : status_list[1], 


            ‘rewards_full’ : [],


            ‘rewards_values : {‘xp’ : 10, ‘points’ : 5},


            ‘timer’ : null,


            ‘completion’ : {‘complete’ : 240, ‘current’ : 80},


            ‘subtasks’ : null


            }

    6. Categories are described using list template while in thematic list and category_name in any other list:
        9. ‘category_name’ = {}  or  list template ([1.3](#bookmark=id.dirgigz17d77))
3. **Create methods operating lists.**
    7. Simple methods can operate following tasks:
        10. Create list:
            1. While creating a list, the user needs to pass the following information to the method: list_name, list_type.
        11. Add task:
            2. While creating a task, the user needs to pass the following information to the method: list_name, task_name.
            3. Then users get to choose: task_type, rewards_full, rewards_values, timer, completion.
            4. After that task gets completed and users can create subtasks under this task.
        12. Create category
            5. While creating a category in thematic list method uses list template and if it gets created in any other list new dict gets created by method and user needs to pass category_name and list_type in thematic list.
    8. Status update and response
        13. The user can update ‘pending’, ‘started’, ‘pause’ and ‘prolonged’ statuses to ‘done’.
        14. The user can update ‘pending’, ‘started’ and ‘pause’ statuses to ‘prolonged’.
        15. The user can update ‘pending’ and ‘pause’ statuses to ‘started’.
        16. The user can update ‘started’ and ‘prolonged’ statuses to ‘pause’.
        17. When the ‘started’ task ends, status will change to ‘done’.
        18. When the timer ends counting, status gets updated to ‘failed’.
        19. When a daily task is not completed at the end of day status gets updated to number_of_days += 1 and the user can update this status to ‘done’ but when a task with this status exists a new task will get delayed by the number of days that has already passed (user can renew this task at will and reset day counter).
4. **Manage bars.**
    9. XP bars will have to update task templates so that section with new XP type gets added **
5. **Manage points.**
6. **Manage shop.**
    10. Shops will work as separate dictionaries
